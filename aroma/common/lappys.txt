<b>About</b>

Installing Google core apps and services on stock EUI wasn't just working properly so I decided to patch the ROM to use my own modified version of OpenGapps, which is called <b>"Lappys"</b>.

Lappys currently has two flavors: <b>"vanilla"</b> and <b>"neapolitan"</b>, the first one is based off the "nano" package and the second one on the "aroma" package - from OpenGapps.


<b>Installation</b>

<*>Download the version you want and push it to the phone.</*>

<*>Install LibertineOS as you're doing right now and boot it WITHOUT flashing our Lappys.</*>

<*>Set the phone up in the Wizard and reboot back to recovery after you're in the Launcher. HINT: Reboot pressing volume +.</*>

<*>JUST THEN you'll flash the Lappys zip file after all.</*>

<*>Reboot to system, wiping dalvik is optional.</*>


<b>Vanilla</b>

Only the core of OpenGapps, usually ~170MB. This package includes:

<*>GMSCore - Fundamental core of Google apps.</*>

<*>Google Service Framework and the login fundamental component.</*>

<*>Widewine, media and maps framework.</*>

<*>Sync services for calendar and contacts.</*>

<*>PlayStore - To download your apps from the market.</*>

<*>Search - Google search engine and all its features.</*>

<*>GoogleTTS - Substitutes the old PicoTTS with a new voice synthesizer.</*>

<*>Hotwork Enrollment - "Ok Google" hotword detection support anywhere.</*>

<*>Gboard - The latest keyboard from Google with glide support.</*>


<b>Neapolitan</b>

Delusion... Work in progress.


<b>Disclaimer</b>

<*>This version of OpenGapps is not official, do not report bugs to the official team or anywhere else.</*>

<*>Those apps were patched to be compatible with EUI, it doesn't mean they'll work 100%.</*>
