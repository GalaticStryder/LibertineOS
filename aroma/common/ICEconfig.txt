<b>Information</b>

<*>The configuration file for ICEsound are currently available in five different versions.</*>

<*>Not all five will always be compatible with this device.</*>

<*>This is a way to experiment different configurations if ICEsound is breaking other signal processing services, like ViPER4Arise for example.</*>


<b>Configurations</b>

<*>ICEconfig 1 is the default configuration.</*>

<*>ICEconfigs 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are alternative configurations using different settings to hopefully provide at least one satisfactory configuration.</*>

<*>ICEconfig 0 is yet another alternative: using no ICEsound configuration file at all.</*>
