# Getting Started



* Welcome to the ARISE™ Sound Systems™ family!



* We'll get you started right away, but let's get you familiar with everything this archive has to offer before flashing it in recovery.



* The Modular Installer allows our sound system to be installed on a modular level, similar to a "plug-and-play" system, where multiple components can be installed and uninstalled to construct a desired sound system at any time, removing any need to start over from scratch.


* This modular method is achieved using /sdcard/arise_customize.prop, when edited by the user with the appropriate values, to instruct the installation script to install/uninstall any of the available modules.


* This file, often referred to as "wishlist", appears in a few places in the archive for easy access and reference, and should be extracted and placed directly in /sdcard and then edited to include the necessary values to build the desired system.


* If this archive is flashed before the user has completed this step, the installation script will abort with an Error 1 along with the reason for the error and the necessary action(s) to take.


* If /sdcard/arise_customize.prop is not found, the abort operation will copy this file to /sdcard so that all that is required is preparation of this file by the user to include the values for the desired installation.


* Below, is a list of the available modules, with which hundreds of different sound system combinations are possible, as well as the amount of /system space they consume:


  * I = Install (can be installed)
  * U = Uninstall (can be uninstalled)
  * D = Delete (can be deleted)
  * M = Multiple (select one from multiple options)
  * ! = Required (required, if not already installed)
