# deep_buffer audio_policy module



* Devices use audio_policy configurations to indicate the available hardware inputs and outputs for audio on the device as well as their corresponding module libraries.


* Although preferred to leave intact, some scenarios require audio_policy manipulation to allow full processing, typically ViPER4Android, of streamed media content like YouTube, Chrome, Spotify, SoundCloud, TuneIn, etc.


* audio_policy manipulation can be reverted by adding a value of "true" to the line entry for restoring deep_buffer.
