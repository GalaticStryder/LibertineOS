* Full consciousness is not required to recognize the inspiration and influence @osm0sis, an undisputed top 10 XDA Developers contributor, has on the ARISE™ team in how we bring our ideas and content to numerous Android devices.


* Inspired by the executions performed by @Chainfire and @YashdSaraf via update-binary shell scripts, @osm0sis has amassed the quintessential database of such implementation in a staggeringly approachable resource in what is likely the most underrated thread in all of XDA.


* With enhanced power and possibilities come more opportunities for hiccups and missteps, and this is where the SDCard Permissions Fix script prepared by @osm0sis can be the perfect remedy for instances when you think your device is playing tricks with you.


* The various symptoms span a broad range of disappearing content and broken operations such as renaming, moving, or deleting files anywhere in /sdcard or /data/media.


* This script is almost always all that is needed to restore full /sdcard and /data/media expected behavior.


* Massive shout-out to @osm0sis from the entire ARISE™ team for pioneering and championing shell via update-binary. This alone is how we are able to do so much with so little. Do yourself a favor by visiting his XDA thread, nothing but good vibes there. :good:
