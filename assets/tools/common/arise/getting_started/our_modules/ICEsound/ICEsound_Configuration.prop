# ICEsound™ Configuration module



* The configuration file for ICEsound is currently available in six different versions.


* Not all six will always be compatible with a particular device.


* This is a way to experiment with a different configuration if ICEsound™ is preventing other signal processing, like ViPER4Arise™ for example.


* ICEconfig 1 is the default configuration.

* ICEconfigs 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are alternative configurations using different settings to hopefully provide at least one satisfactory configuration.

* Final alternative: using no ICEsound™ configuration file at all.
